- HSGF
    - Code documentation
        - Every source code file should have a short documentation at the top of the file describing its contents and listing potentially relevant notes
    - Each graph builder
        - Has a single and parallel version
        - Where the single one is closer to the original code, while the parallel one has fewer or none of the original code comments and is generally more optimized 
    - Main contribution of this work 
    - Building layered graphs from the bottom up
        - Allows to specify (available) graph builders and subset selectors for each level
    - One trait definition for the HSGFStyleBuilder, which can be either an Enum- or a ClosureStyleBuilder
- DEG
    - [GitHub](https://github.com/Visual-Computing/DynamicExplorationGraph/)
    - See the license on GitHub or at the top of the corresponding file
    - Based on the main branch, specifically commit `305e121`
        - Specifically relevant for the re-implementation is [builder.h](https://github.com/Visual-Computing/DynamicExplorationGraph/blob/main/cpp/deglib/include/builder.h)
        - Important, this corresponds to the latest version of the DEG by the authors, and not the later renamed (and original) crEG implementation. However, we expect the latest version to also be the most performant.
- (N)SSG
    - [GitHub](https://github.com/ZJULearning/SSG/)
    - See the license on GitHub or at the top of the corresponding file
    - Based on the master branch, specifically commit `f573041`
        - Specifically relevant for the re-implementation is [index_ssg.cpp](https://github.com/ZJULearning/SSG/blob/master/src/index_ssg.cpp)
- Efanna 
    - [GitHub](https://github.com/ZJULearning/efanna_graph)
    - See note about the license at the top of the corresponding file
    - Based on the master branch, specifically commit `50c4445`
        - Specifically relevant for the re-implementation is [index_graph.cpp](https://github.com/ZJULearning/efanna_graph/blob/master/src/index_graph.cpp)
- RNGG
    - Builds a random graph that allows for fast and basic testing and evaluation
- Selectors 
    - Random, Flooding, FloodingRepeat, Hubs
    - See file for more information on the different selectors
- `src/utils`
    - Utility, primarily for evaluation
- `src/py`
    - Collective folder and exports to generate the Python binding *hsgf*
    - /benches/bench.py can be seen as a unit tester for the Python binding *hsgf*
